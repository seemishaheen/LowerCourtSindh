        The first step taken towards setting up of regular judicial system in Azad Jammu and Kashmir was the passing of
        Resolution No. 226 titled Judicial Secretariat by the interim Government. It was circulated to Sessions Judges
        Poonch and Mirpur and District Magistrates Poonch, Mirpur and Muzaffarabad by the Secretary Law and Order under
        No. 1311-15/147/L/CP-III dated 24.3.1948. It mainly provided that Sessions Judges shall try all cases triable by
        them under the Criminal Procedure Code and a sentence passed by the court of Sessions was subject to
        confirmation by the Government in accordance with the provisions of Section 374 of the Code of Criminal
        Procedure.
    <h3> COURTS AND LAWS CODE 1948</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;"> The judicial system in Azad Kashmir was regularized with the passing of Courts and Laws Code 1948 vide
        Resolution No. 82. It provided for the establishment of the High Court and all the lower courts down to the
        courts of Sub Judges and Magistrates. It was comprehensive enough and covered almost all aspects of
        establishment of courts and the laws to be administered by the law courts. It also provided for appointment of
        Muftis who were appointed by the High Court with the sanction of the Government; however, Mufti Ala was to be
        appointed by the Azad Kashmir Government for advice on all questions of Islamic Shariah. Qualifications for
        appointment of Judges of the High Court were also prescribed. Powers of appointment of officers of the High
        Court and admission of advocates were vested in the Chief Justice. The High Court was the ultimate court of
        appeal from all civil courts of Azad Kashmir besides other testamentary, intestate or matrimonial jurisdiction
        as prescribed by law. The High Court was vested with overall control of the courts subordinate to it. The Code
        also provided for limits of jurisdiction of civil and criminal courts subordinate to it. It also provided for
        limits of jurisdiction of civil and criminal courts, appeals, transfer of cases, revision etc. and law of
        procedure. The High Court was vested with the powers to confer magisterial powers under various sections of the
        Criminal Procedure Code. The High Court was also vested with the powers to frame rules on certain matters. All
        laws and enactments of the Dogra Rule inconsistent with the provisions of the Code or with the enactments passed
        or adapted by the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Government were repealed and all other laws so far as practicable were
        allowed to remain force.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        The High Court was established under Resolution No. 372 passed on 18th May 1949. Through this resolution, one
        post of Judge High Court, one Steno, one Clerk of Court, one Registrar High Court, one Assistant Advocate
        General and one Chaprasi for the High Court were created. Through another resolution No. 594 passed on
        9.10.1948, it was decided that instead of one Judge there would be two Judges of the High Court. It was provided
        that in the event of difference between the two on any point the opinion of the Chief Justice would prevail. It
        was also provided that the incumbent Judge of the High Court would be the Chief Justice because of his seniority
        in service in Azad Government. Under an order of the President issued 8.11.1948, Mr. Justice Abdul Majeed Khan
        was appointed Chief Justice of the High Court. Sheikh Abdul Rashid was appointed as puisne Judge of the High
        Court. At that time the Headquarter of the High Court was at Rawalpindi with the code name of “Lion”. Under
        Cabinet Order No. 233/50 dated 11.7.1950, actions of Minister for Law in fixing the headquarter of the High
        Court at “Lion” in the first instance and then in shifting the headquarter of the High Court from “Lion” to
        Muzaffarabad were confirmed.
    <h3>HIGH COURT UNDER RULES OF BUSINESS</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Under the Rules of Business issued on 28.12.1950, power of appointment of Chief Justice
        and Judges of the High Court was vested in the Supreme Head which was defined as the Supreme Head of the Azad
        Kashmir Movement. The Chief Justice remained vested with the power of recruitment, posting and transfer,
        creation of posts, retirement and disciplinary actions with respect to all posts in the Judicial Department.
        Rule 5 Schedule-I of the Rules of Business gave autonomy to the Chief Justice to sanction all financial
        expenditure with respect to Judicial Department provided in the budget and to exercise all financial powers not
        vested in the Council or delegated to a subordinate authority by any specific order. Pecuniary jurisdiction of
        the subordinate courts was also regulated by these Rules of Business.

        The Rules of Business of 1950 were superseded by the Rules of Business of 1952. The latter rules, however,
        contained the provisions of the earlier rules giving full power to the Chief Justice in matters of control on
        subordinate judiciary, appointments and sanctioning of financial expenditure provided in the budget. The rules
        were again revised on 29.11.1958, which also contained similar provisions with respect to the High Court.</p>

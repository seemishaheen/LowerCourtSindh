                        At the time of division of India into two independent States i.e. India and Pakistan, the
                        princely States were given the choice to join either of the countries. Kashmir was the largest
                        State amongst 560 princely States of the British India. As per partition plan, the entire State
                        should have gone to Pakistan. Almost all political parties working in the State advised the
                        Maharaja to accede to Pakistan. Muslim Conference also passed a resolution on 22nd September
                        1947 favoring accession of the State to Pakistan. The Maharaja failed to accede to Pakistan and
                        the Muslim felt that some conspiracy was going on between the Maharaja and Congress leaders,
                        therefore, the Kashmiri people started armed struggle for liberation. The Muslim fighters though
                        without any regular army, ammunition or regular line of communication working behind them,
                        fought under the banner of Peoples Army of Liberation. The Peoples Army cleared a large part of
                        the State from Dogra occupation forces. As per Constitution of Azad Jamm and Kashmir by Justice
                        Syed Manzoor Hussain Gilani, the part of the State liberated by the people comprises 4144 square
                        miles, out of which 1646 sq. miles is from Kashmir Province and 2498 sq. miles from Jammu
                        Province. The territory conquered, captured and finally brought under control is known as Azad
                        Jammu and Kashmir </p>
